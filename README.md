# Knockk : Project Portfolio
*A social networking applcation*

## Overview
### What is Knockk?
Knockk is a project aimed to create a network for residents of a building complext... **but why**?

At present, *no* social network exists for apartment building residents, leaving neighbors strangers to one another.  Knockk is here to solve that. 
> Mark 12:30-31 says, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these” (New International Version, 1973/2011, Mark 12:30-31).

The bible commands us to love your neighbor as yourself, but most people do not know their neighbors. With Knockk, residents can get to know who lives around them and connect to form Godly relationships that will benefit God’s kingdom.

### To solve this...
Two user facing applications (and one API) was developed. Phase 1 of creating this network invloved implementing these features:

| Admin     | Resident |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Account creation | Verify residents |
View units (above, below, and to the sides) | Manage residents |
View residents of a unit | |
View a resident | |
Connect with a resident | |
Edit profile  |  |

A non-functional requirement of 'not storing passwords [in the database] as clear text' by implementing the BCryptPasswordEncoder in the Spring Boot Application.

| **Technology** | **Version** | **Purpose** | **Chosen** |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Draw.io | v27.7.17 | Tool for technical diagramming. | Lots of shapes for different diagramming uses. |
| Expo | v51.0.0 | Accelerates development. | Recommended framework in the React Native documentation. Companies like Pizza Hut, codeacademy, and Insider all chose to integrate Expo within their apps. |
| Figma | v16.13.3 | Tool for wireframing. | Commonly used in the industry. Sleek user interface that makes wireframing enjoyable and easy. |
| GitHub | v3.4.6 | Version control in the cloud. | Commonly used in the industry. Allows developers to store code in repositories and track changes in the cloud. |
| Jira | v9.17.0 | Tool for project management. | Commonly used in the industry. Will help the team deliver code faster by managing tasks and tracking progress. |
| MacBook Pro M1 Chip Ventura | 13.5.2 | Development environment. | Developers’ current computer. |
| Node.js | v20.18.0 | Runtime environment that will execute the Expo applications. | Needed for Expo Development Builds. |
| PostgreSQL | v15.6 | Database to store data. | Database instance that Supabase provides. |
| React Native | v0.74 | Framework to build mobile and web applications. | Popular framework with large community support. Selected over Flutter because JavaScript is a popular programming compared to Dart; selected over React because React is not cross-platform. |
| Sentry | v6.1.0 | Capture reporting and performance issues for Expo. Crash reporting, performance monitoring, error tracking, gathering user feedback related to errors. | Can easily integrate into Expo project and provides great interface for reporting, monitoring, and error tracking. |
| Spring Boot | v3.1.4 | To develop the backend REST API. | Commonly used in the industry. Utilizes object-oriented principles, which is unlike other frameworks like Express (which uses a non-OOP language, JavaScript). |
| Supabase | v1.204.4 | Cloud service provider that hosts PostgreSQL databases. Alternative to Firebase. | Relational database provider in the cloud. Provides monitoring and reporting of the Postgres instance. |
| TypeScript | v5.6.3 | JavaScript superset used in React Native, strongly typed. | Offers additional safety to JavaScript which allows for more readable and maintainable code. |
| Visual Studio Code | v1.9134 | Tool for code development. | Commonly used in the industry. Lightweight IDE with a simple user interface and rich extensions. |
| Word | v16.80 | Tool for documentation. | Team is familiar with Word. Easy to create documents. |

### Best Practices

### Deployed in the cloud? CI/CD
### What'd you learn? Why?
### What technical approach did you take? Include a variety of design diagrams, class diagrams, etc. to support the technical aspects of your project.
### What risks and challenges did you have? How did you overcome these and what resources did you use?  What risk management approaches did you take?
### What outstanding issues do you have?
